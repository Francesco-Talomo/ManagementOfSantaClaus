  <h1>MANAGEMENT FOR CHRISTMAS</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Welcome !</h2>
  <p class="lead">Dashing thru the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight. Oh
Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I’d take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And so we got upset
Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Now the ground in white, go it while you’re still young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two forty for his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack you’ll take the lead
Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh</p>
